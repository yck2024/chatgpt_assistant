Give me one concrete thing I could do to be better using these conversations by focusing on what I said and how I responded to the people in my life. Support this one concrete way I can be better with several examples to help me identify patterns I might not realize. Be candid",
    "daily_Summary": "I need a summary of my day based on my conversation transcripts from yesterday. Look at the transcript and respond with a summary of my day that I can use to review everything that happened quickly.\nHere are the things I want to be included in the summary:\n- Key meetings and conversations I participated in\n- Important information I learned or shared\n- Decisions I made or was involved in\n- Problems I encountered and solutions I found\n- Major themes or patterns in my conversations\n\nFormat the summary to be readable and insightful, highlighting what matters most about my day. Keep it brief but comprehensive, capturing the essence of my experiences rather than listing every detail.\nShow me the summary in chronological order when possible, starting with morning activities and ending with evening ones. Prioritize significant events over routine interactions.",
    "daily_Todo": "I need a comprehensive to-do list based on my conversation transcripts. Please analyze the transcript and identify all tasks, commitments, and follow-up actions I mentioned or agreed to.\nImportantly: Only use items that I specifically said I would do. Do not include things other people said they would do.\nFor each item, include enough detail that I can understand what needs to be done without having to review the entire transcript again. Use action verbs at the beginning of each task.\nGroup related tasks together when possible, and highlight any dependencies between tasks (e.g., \"Complete X before starting Y\").\nExclude routine activities or general comments that don't require specific action.",
    "daily_diary": "Give me these points with quotes:\n- Highlights of the Day:\n    - \n- Areas for Improvement:\n\n- Reflections/Thoughts:\n    \n- Small things that bring you joy throughout the day"
