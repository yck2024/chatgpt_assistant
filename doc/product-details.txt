🚀 AI Prompt Assistant - Product Details


📌 WHAT IS AI PROMPT ASSISTANT?

AI Prompt Assistant is a Chrome extension that supercharges your AI conversations by letting you create and instantly access custom prompt shortcuts. Simply type "//" followed by your shortcut name, and your carefully crafted prompts appear instantly—no more copying and pasting from notes or retyping the same instructions over and over.


😤 THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES

If you use AI assistants regularly, you've probably experienced these frustrations:

• Repetitive typing: Rewriting the same prompts every time you want a translation, code review, or text revision
• Lost prompts: Forgetting that perfect prompt you crafted last week
• Platform switching: Maintaining different prompt collections for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
• Inconsistent results: Slightly different phrasing leading to varying AI responses
• Wasted time: Hunting through notes or documents to find the right prompt


⚡ HOW IT WORKS

1. Create once, use everywhere: Save your best prompts with easy-to-remember shortcuts
2. Type "//" to activate: In any supported AI platform, type "//" to see your prompts
3. Instant autocomplete: Type "//rev" to filter to prompts starting with "rev"
4. One-key insert: Press Enter or Tab to insert your selected prompt
5. Works across platforms: Same prompts, same shortcuts on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and more

💡 WHY INSTALL AI PROMPT ASSISTANT?

⏱️ Save Time
Stop retyping the same prompts. A prompt you use 10 times a day becomes a 2-second shortcut instead of 30 seconds of typing. That's potentially hours saved each month.

🎯 Get Better Results
Carefully crafted prompts produce better AI responses. Save your best prompts and use them consistently to get reliably good results every time.

🔄 Work Across Platforms
Whether you prefer ChatGPT for coding, Claude for writing, or Gemini for research, your prompts follow you. No need to maintain separate collections.

📂 Stay Organized
Build a personal library of prompts organized by task. Code review, translation, summarization, email writing—all accessible in seconds with meaningful shortcuts.

🤝 Share Knowledge
Export your prompt collection and share it with your team. Import prompts from colleagues. Build collective prompt wisdom.

🔒 Protect Your Work
Back up your prompts to Google Drive. Even if you switch computers or browsers, your prompt collection is safe and restorable.
