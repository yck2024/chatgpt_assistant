# AI Prompt Assistant - Product Details

## What is AI Prompt Assistant?

AI Prompt Assistant is a Chrome extension that supercharges your AI conversations by letting you create and instantly access custom prompt shortcuts. Simply type `//` followed by your shortcut name, and your carefully crafted prompts appear instantly—no more copying and pasting from notes or retyping the same instructions over and over.

## The Problem It Solves

If you use AI assistants regularly, you've probably experienced these frustrations:

- **Repetitive typing**: Rewriting the same prompts every time you want a translation, code review, or text revision
- **Lost prompts**: Forgetting that perfect prompt you crafted last week
- **Platform switching**: Maintaining different prompt collections for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
- **Inconsistent results**: Slightly different phrasing leading to varying AI responses
- **Wasted time**: Hunting through notes or documents to find the right prompt

## How It Works

1. **Create once, use everywhere**: Save your best prompts with easy-to-remember shortcuts
2. **Type `//` to activate**: In any supported AI platform, type `//` to see your prompts
3. **Instant autocomplete**: Type `//rev` to filter to prompts starting with "rev"
4. **One-key insert**: Press Enter or Tab to insert your selected prompt
5. **Works across platforms**: Same prompts, same shortcuts on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and more

## Why Install AI Prompt Assistant?

### Save Time
Stop retyping the same prompts. A prompt you use 10 times a day becomes a 2-second shortcut instead of 30 seconds of typing. That's potentially hours saved each month.

### Get Better Results
Carefully crafted prompts produce better AI responses. Save your best prompts and use them consistently to get reliably good results every time.

### Work Across Platforms
Whether you prefer ChatGPT for coding, Claude for writing, or Gemini for research, your prompts follow you. No need to maintain separate collections.

### Stay Organized
Build a personal library of prompts organized by task. Code review, translation, summarization, email writing—all accessible in seconds with meaningful shortcuts.

### Share Knowledge
Export your prompt collection and share it with your team. Import prompts from colleagues. Build collective prompt wisdom.

### Protect Your Work
Back up your prompts to Google Drive. Even if you switch computers or browsers, your prompt collection is safe and restorable.
